A program that prompts the store owner for the amount of cash at the 
beginning of the day and for the amount of cash at the end of the day, as 
well as the name of the ledger text file. Your program should calculate if 
the actual amount of cash at the end of the day equals the expected value. 
If an error is found while reading the text file, the user should be allowed 
to choose another file.
